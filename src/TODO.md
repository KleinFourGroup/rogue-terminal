# The Big To-Do List

Right now this is just a stream-of-consciousness dump

## Mechanics

* Finish / flesh out pathfinding

Current system is pretty rudimentary.  We need to be able to ignore certain (types of) enemies, etc.

* Vision / line of sight / visibility

** Overhaul actions so ones in fog of war can be instantly completed with no animations

* Traps

This will necessitate changing how turns work

* Drops

* Combat!!!

* Inventory system

* Level generation and multiple levels

## Graphics / Juice

* TextSprites with lists of letters

* TextSprites with larger text

* Entities with multiple TextSprites

* The UI.  All of it.

* Faster / more pre-defined animations

* Input support!!!
